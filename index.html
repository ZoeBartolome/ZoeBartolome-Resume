        My name is Zoe Bartolome. I am currently a first year student at University of California Riverside. My major is Pre-Business. I have hopes of taking a concentration in marketing and eventually going on to work in brand industries.<br><br>

        I spent the majority of my free time during high school volunteering at various organizations. For the majority of my senior year I volunteered at the local care center in my hometown, The Upland Rehabilitation and Care Center. This care center specialized in elderly care and care for those who cannot or whose families can no longer care for them. I loved my experience at the Upland Rahabilitaion and Care Center. I learned so many things form the residents that lived there. Many of whom who were alive during the early years of the modern development of the town. They shared their views on the history of the town in ways that history books could not. Their personal experiences changed the way that I viewed my home. The city of Upland that grew up around was very different from theirs and it was amazing to see it from their points of view. I had a variety of different jobs tasked to me at the care center. I would help the activities directors plan the events for the residents, help in the dining service, and deliver mail to the residents. One of my favorite events to plan was the Residents Luau. This was a Hawaiian themed party for the residents and their families. With the activities directors, we decorated the entire courtyard to look like a luau. The nurses and the residents families brought food for everyone to enjoy. Seeing the way that everyone interacted and the way the residents were happy with what they were given humbled me. It helped me be more appreciative of everything given to me. I also volunteered at the Foothill Family Thrift Store during my senior year. This job consisted of working the front cashier, collection donations, paperwork, and organizing the store. I really enjoyed volunteering here. I did this as a part of the service learning project seniors were required to do for graduation. I was able to volunteer with some of my best friends. It became our new after school hang out spot. We would all meet up after school for lunch at the restaurant next door before going in for our shift. Throughout my four years of high school I was a member of the Upland High School Key Club. This was an organization that did a number of community service events and activities in and around our town. This club is what introduced me to volunteer work and community service. It was a useful way for me to spend my free time during the week. As opposed to being at home and doing nothing, I was out volunteering and helping benefit my community. I think that volunteering is a big part of what make a community great. Its about people coming together with the common goal of making their community amazing.
